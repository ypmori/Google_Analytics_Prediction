    "After 50,000 iterations of the tic-tac-toe game, ~58% of the games were 'X' win, ~29% were 'O' win, and ~13% were ties.\n",
    "\n",
    "I found that player 'X' has a much higher win rate than player 'O'. The only difference is the turn order ('X' always goes first), therefore we can postulate that the 1st move gives a player a significant advantage **when moves are randomized.** \n",
    "\n",
    "In a real game with human players, the these win rates may be very different. While a first-turn advantange may still exist, each player will actively pursue and deny 3-in-a-row victories (unlike this program, where the moves are made without any regard for the win condition). I would expect the majority of outcomes to be ties in a real-world scenario, and win rates between 'X' and 'O' should be much closer."
